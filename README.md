# BSG_Projections
Working Projections for BSG Game in my Strategic Management MBA Capstone

There are three .csv files that I update after each decision. The data comes from the "Comparative Competitive Efforts" Section of the BSG Game. Using this data won't help you with your game, however, cloning this project and tracking your own comparative competitive efforts and running the models should help you out a bit. 

## Setup

### bsg_prices_actual.csv
This dataset contains the Average Pricing in each Industry across two of the three major segments (Internet and Wholesale). I decided not to do any modeling for the Private Label segment for two reasons. First, pricing and competition here has not been consistent across all firms. Second, my firm did not compete here very often because we rarely had enough excess capacity to produce at a competitive price. When we did, we would use the Private Label segment to sell shoes at the COGS or use Exchange rates to "dump" into other regions and disrupt teams who were relying on the income to meet shareholder expectations. A word of caution if you do this -- the game will alert the instructor and a "warning" will be issued about "dumping practices." Use this sparingly otherwise you may face a "fine" by a foreign government for unfair practices.
